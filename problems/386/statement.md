You are given an array of n integers. You will perform n-1 operations on the array.

In one operation, you will choose two numbers a and b from the array, delete both of them from the array and add |a - b| into the array.

Your task is to find a sequence of operations such that the last number remaining in the array is 0.

# Input

The first line has an integer n: the length of the array.

The next line has n integers x\_1, x\_2,\dots, x\_n: the contents of the array.

# Output

Print n-1 lines each containing two integers a and b: the numbers chosen in the operations. You can print any valid solution.

If no solution exists, print only -1.

# Constraints

- 2 \le n \le 1000
- 1 \le x\_i \le 1000

# Example

Input:

```
5
2 7 4 12 1
```

Output:

```
2 12
7 10
4 1
3 3
```

*Explanation*: The array changes as follows:

- [2, 7, 4, 12, 1] \rightarrow remove 2 and 12, add 10
- [7, 4, 1, 10] \rightarrow remove 7 and 10, add 3
- [4, 1, 3] \rightarrow remove 4 and 1, add 3
- [3, 3] \rightarrow remove 3 and 3, add 0
- [0]: the final array
