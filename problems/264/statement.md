You are given an array of n integers. Your task is to calculate the mode each window of k elements, from left to right.

The mode is the most frequent element in an array. If there are several possible modes, choose the smallest of them.

# Input

The first line contains two integers n and k: the number of elements and the size of the window.

Then there are n integers x\_1,x\_2,\ldots,x\_n: the contents of the array.

# Output

Print n-k+1 values: the modes.

# Constraints

- 1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5
- 1 \le x\_i \le 10^9

# Example

Input:

```
8 3
1 2 3 2 5 2 4 4
```

Output:

```
1 2 2 2 2 4
```
