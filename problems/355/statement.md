Your task is to construct an array x\_1,x\_2,\dots,x\_n consisting of n integers.

The array must satisfy m constraints of the form (l,r,s): the sum x\_l + x\_{l+1} + \dots + x\_r must equal s.

# Input

The first line has two integers n and m: the length of the array and the number of constraints.

The next m lines each have three integers l, r and s: the description of the constraints.

# Output

If a solution exists, print `YES` on the first line.

On the second line, print n integers x\_1, x\_2,\dots, x\_n: the contents of the array. All elements of the array must satisfy -10^{15} \le x\_i \le 10^{15} and the array must satisfy all given constraints. You can print any valid solution.

If no solution exists, just print `NO`.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n \le 5000
- 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5
- 1 \le l \le r \le n
- -10^9 \le s \le 10^9

# Example

Input:

```
5 3
1 3 3
3 5 3
4 4 -1
```

Output:

```
YES
0 2 1 -1 3
```
