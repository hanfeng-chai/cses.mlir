There are n line segments whose endpoints have integer coordinates. Each x-coordinate is between 0 and m. The slope of each segment is an integer.

For each x-coordinate 0,1,\dots,m, find the maximum point in any line segment. If there is no segment at some point, the maximum is -1.

# Input

The first line has two integers n and m: the number of line segments and the maximum x-coordinate.

The next n lines describe the line segments. Each line has four integers x\_1, y\_1, x\_2 and y\_2: there is a line segment between points (x\_1,y\_1) and (x\_2,y\_2).

# Output

Print m+1 integers: the maximum points for x=0,1,\dots,m.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n, m \le 10^5
- 0 \le x\_1 < x\_2 \le m
- 0 \le y\_1,y\_2 \le 10^9

# Example

Input:

```
4 5
1 1 3 3
1 2 4 2
2 4 5 7
2 8 5 2
```

Output:

```
-1 2 8 6 6 7
```
