Given an undirected weighted graph, determine for each edge the minimum spanning tree cost if the edge must be included in the spanning tree.

# Input

The first line has two integers n and m: the number of nodes and edges. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\dots,n.

The following m lines describe the edges. Each line has three integers a, b, w: there is an edge between nodes a and b with weight w.

You can assume that the graph is connected and simple and each edge appears at most once in the graph.

# Output

For each edge in the input order, print the minimum spanning tree cost when the edge is included.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n \le 10^5
- 1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5
- 1 \le a,b \le n
- 1 \le w \le 10^9

# Example

Input:

```
5 6
1 2 4
1 3 2
2 4 2
3 4 1
3 5 4
4 5 3
```

Output:

```
10
8
8
8
9
8
```
