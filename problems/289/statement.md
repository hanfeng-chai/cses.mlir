You are given two permutations a and b such that a\_i \neq b\_i in every position. Create a third permutation c such that a\_i \neq c\_i and b\_i \neq c\_i in every position.

# Input

The first line has an integer n: the permutation size.

The second line has n integers a\_1,a\_2,\dots,a\_n.

The third line has n integers b\_1,b\_2,\dots,b\_n.

# Output

Print n integers c\_1,c\_2,\dots,c\_n. You can print any valid solution. If there are no solutions, print `IMPOSSIBLE`.

# Constraints

- 2 \le n \le 10^5

# Example

Input:

```
5
1 3 2 5 4
4 1 3 2 5
```

Output:

```
3 2 5 4 1
```
