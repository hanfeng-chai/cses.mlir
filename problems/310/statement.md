You are given a tree with n nodes. Some nodes contain a coin.

Your task is to answer q queries of the form: what is the shortest length of a path from node a to node b that visits all nodes with coins?

# Input

The first line contains two integers n and q: the number of nodes and queries. The nodes are numbered 1, 2, \dots, n.

The second line contains n integers c\_1, c\_2,\dots, c\_n. If c\_i = 1, node i has a coin. If c\_i = 0, node i doesn't have a coin. You can assume at least one node has a coin.

Then there are n-1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b.

Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. Each line contains two integers a and b: the start and end nodes.

# Output

Print q integers: the answers to the queries.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5
- 1 \le a, b \le n
