You are given two arrays of n integers.

Your task is to select a nonempty prefix from both arrays such that the average of all selected numbers is as large as possible.

# Input

The first line has an integer n.

The second line has n integers a\_1,a\_2,\dots,a\_n: the numbers in the first array.

The third line has n integers b\_1,b\_2,\dots,b\_n: the numbers in the second array.

# Output

Print two numbers: the prefix sizes.

Your answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative difference to the maximum average is at most 10^{-6}.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n \le 10^5
- 1 \le a\_i, b\_i \le 10^9

# Example

Input:

```
4
1 5 5 2
3 1 3 1
```

Output:

```
3 1
```

Explanation: if you choose the prefixes [1,5,5] and [3], the average is (1+5+5+3)/4=3.5 which is the maximum possible average.
