Given an n \times m grid and two squares a=(y\_1,x\_1) and b=(y\_2,x\_2), create a path from a to b that visits each square exactly once.

For example, here is a path from a=(1,3) to b=(3,6) in a 4 \times 7 grid:

# Input

The first input line has an integer t: the number of tests.

After this, there are t lines that describe the tests. Each line has six integers n, m, y\_1, x\_1, y\_2 and x\_2.

In all tests 1 \le y\_1,y\_2 \le n and 1 \le x\_1,x\_2 \le m. In addition, y\_1 \neq y\_2 or x\_1 \neq x\_2.

# Output

Print YES, if it is possible to construct a path, and NO otherwise.

If there is a path, also print its description which consists of characters `U` (up), `D` (down), `L` (left) and `R` (right). If there are several paths, you can print any of them.

# Constraints

- 1 \le t \le 100
- 1 \le n \le 50
- 1 \le m \le 50

# Example

Input:

Output:
