You are given an array of n integers. Your task is to calculate the number of non-empty subsets whose elements' *bitwise and* is equal to k for each k = 0, 1,\dots, n.

# Input

The first line has an integer n: the size of the array.

The next line has n integers a\_1, a\_2,\dots, a\_n: the contents of the array.

# Output

Print n + 1 integers as specified above modulo 10^9 + 7.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5
- 0 \le a\_i \le n

# Example

Input:

```
4
3 1 3 4
```

Output:

```
7 4 0 3 1
```
