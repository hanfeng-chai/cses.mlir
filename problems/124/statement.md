Given an array of n integers, your task is to process q queries of the following types:

1. increase each value in range [a,b] by u
2. what is the value at position k?

# Input

The first input line has two integers n and q: the number of values and queries.

The second line has n integers x\_1,x\_2,\dots,x\_n: the array values.

Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. The format of each line is either "1 a b u" or "2 k".

# Output

Print the result of each query of type 2.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n,q \le 2 \cdot 10^5
- 1 \le x\_i, u \le 10^9
- 1 \le k \le n
- 1 \le a \le b \le n

# Example

Input:

```
8 3
3 2 4 5 1 1 5 3
2 4
1 2 5 1
2 4
```

Output:

```
5
6
```
