A computer network has n computers and n-1 connections between two computers. Information can be exchanged between every pair of computers using the connections.

Each connection has a certain transfer speed. Let d(a,b) denote the transfer speed between computers a and b, which is the speed of the slowest connection on the route between a and b. Your task is to compute the sum of transfer speeds between all pairs of computers.

# Input

The first line contains the integer n: the number of computers. The computers are numbered 1,2,\dots,n.

After this, there are n-1 lines, which describe the connections. Each line has three integers a, b and x: there is a connection between computers a and b with transfer speed x.

# Output

Print one integer: the sum of transfer speeds.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5
- 1 \le x \le 10^6

# Example

Input:

```
4
1 2 5
2 3 1
2 4 2
```

Output:

```
12
```

*Explanation*: The following figure corresponds to the sample input:

Here d(1,2)=5, d(1,3)=1, d(1,4)=2, d(2,3)=1, d(2,4)=2, and d(3,4)=1, so the sum of transfer speeds is 12.
