You are given an array of n integers. Your task is to calculate the bitwise xor of each window of k elements, from left to right.

In this problem the input data is large and it is created using a generator.

# Input

The first line contains two integers n and k: the number of elements and the size of the window.

The next line contains four integers x, a, b and c: the input generator parameters. The input is generated as follows:

- x\_1=x
- x\_i=(ax\_{i-1}+b) \bmod c for i=2,3,\dots,n

# Output

Print the xor of all window xors.

# Constraints

- 1 \le k \le n \le 10^7
- 0 \le x, a, b \le 10^9
- 1 \le c \le 10^9

# Example

Input:

```
8 5
3 7 1 11
```

Output:

```
0
```

Explanation: The input array is [3,0,1,8,2,4,7,6]. The windows are [3,0,1,8,2], [0,1,8,2,4], [1,8,2,4,7] and [8,2,4,7,6], and their xors are 8, 15, 8 and 15. Thus, the answer is 8 \oplus 15 \oplus 8 \oplus 15 = 0.
