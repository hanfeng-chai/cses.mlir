Given an array of n integers, count the number of subsequences where each element is distinct.

A subsequence is a sequence of array elements from left to right that may have gaps.

# Input

The first line has an integer n: the array size.

The second line has n integers x\_1,x\_2,\dots,x\_n: the array contents.

# Output

Print the number of subsequences with distinct elements. The answer can be large, so print it modulo 10^9+7.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5
- 1 \le x\_i \le 10^9

# Example

Input:

```
4
1 2 1 3
```

Output:

```
11
```

*Explanation*: The subsequences are [1] (two times), [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3] (two times), [2,1], [2,3], [1,2,3] and [2,1,3].
