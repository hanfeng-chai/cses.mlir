Given an array of n integers, your task is to calculate the number of increasing subsequences it contains. If two subsequences have the same values but in different positions in the array, they are counted separately.

# Input

The first input line has an integer n: the size of the array.

The second line has n integers x\_1,x\_2,\dots,x\_n: the contents of the array.

# Output

Print one integer: the number of increasing subsequences modulo 10^9+7.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5
- 1 \le x\_i \le 10^9

# Example

Input:

```
3
2 1 3
```

Output:

```
5
```

Explanation: The increasing subsequences are [2], [1], [3], [2,3] and [1,3].
