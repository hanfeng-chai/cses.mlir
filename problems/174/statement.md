Let p(n,k) denote the kth permutation (in lexicographical order) of 1 \dots n. For example, p(4,1)=[1,2,3,4] and p(4,2)=[1,2,4,3].

Your task is to process two types of tests:

1. Given n and k, find p(n,k)
2. Given n and p(n,k), find k

# Input

The first line has an integer t: the number of tests.

Each test is either "1 n k" or "2 n p(n,k)".

# Output

For each test, print the answer according to the example.

# Constraints

- 1 \le t \le 1000
- 1 \le n \le 20
- 1 \le k \le n!

# Example

Input:

```
6
1 4 1
1 4 2
2 4 1 2 3 4
2 4 1 2 4 3
1 5 42
2 5 2 4 5 3 1
```

Output:

```
1 2 3 4
1 2 4 3
1
2
2 4 5 3 1
42
```
