Given n horizontal and vertical line segments, your task is to calculate the number of their intersection points.

You can assume that no parallel line segments intersect, and no endpoint of a line segment is an intersection point.

# Input

The first line has an integer n: the number of line segments.

Then there are n lines describing the line segments. Each line has four integers: x\_1, y\_1, x\_2 and y\_2: a line segment begins at point (x\_1,y\_1) and ends at point (x\_2,y\_2).

# Output

Print the number of intersection points.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n \le 10^5
- -10^6 \le x\_1 \le x\_2 \le 10^6
- -10^6 \le y\_1 \le y\_2 \le 10^6
- (x\_1,y\_1) \neq (x\_2,y\_2)

# Example

Input:

```
3
2 3 7 3
3 1 3 5
6 2 6 6
```

Output:

```
2
```
