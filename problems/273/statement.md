There is a hidden permutation a\_1, a\_2,\dots, a\_n of integers 1, 2,\dots, n. Your task is to find this permutation.

To do this, you can ask questions: you can choose a binary string b\_1b\_2\dots b\_n and you will receive the binary string b\_{a\_1}b\_{a\_2}\dots b\_{a\_n}.

# Interaction

This is an interactive problem. Your code will interact with the grader using standard input and output. You should start by reading a single integer n: the length of the permutation.

On your turn, you can print one of the following:

- "?\ b\_1b\_2\dots b\_n", where b\_i\in\{0, 1\}: The grader will return the binary string b\_{a\_1}b\_{a\_2}\dots b\_{a\_n}.
- "!\ a\_1\ a\_2 \dots a\_n": report that the hidden permutation is a\_1, a\_2,\dots, a\_n. Your program must terminate after this.

Each line should be followed by a line break. You must make sure the output gets flushed after printing each line.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n \le 1000
- you can ask at most 10 questions of type ?

# Example

```
3
? 100
100
? 010
001
? 001
010
! 1 3 2
```

*Explanation*: The hidden permutation is [1, 3, 2]. In the first question b\_1b\_2b\_3 = 100 and the grader returns b\_{a\_1}b\_{a\_2}b\_{a\_3} = b\_1b\_3b\_2 = 100. In the second question b\_1b\_2b\_3 = 010 and the grader returns b\_1b\_3b\_2 = 001.
