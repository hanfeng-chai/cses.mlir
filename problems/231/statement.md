Your task is to efficiently process the following types of queries:

1. Add a line ax+b that is active in range [l,r]
2. Find the maximum point in any active line at position x

# Input

The first line has an integer n: the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the queries. The format of each line is either "1 a b l r" or "2 x".

# Output

Print the answer for each query of type 2. If no line is active, print `NO`.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5
- -10^9 \le a,b \le 10^9
- 0 \le x \le 10^5
- 0 \le l \le r \le 10^5

# Example

Input:

```
