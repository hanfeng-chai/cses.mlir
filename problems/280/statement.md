You are given an array of n integers. Consider the xors of all 2^n subsets of the array (including the empty subset with xor equal to zero).

Your task is to find the k smallest subset xors.

# Input

The first line has two integers n and k: the size of the array and the number of subset xors k.

The next line has n integers x\_1, x\_2,\dots, x\_n: the contents of the array.

# Output

Print k integers: the k smallest subset xors in increasing order.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5
- 1 \le k \le \min(2^n, 2 \cdot 10^5)
- 0 \le x\_i \le 10^9

# Example

Input:

```
4 9
3 5 14 8
```

Output:

```
0 0 3 3 5 5 6 6 8
```
