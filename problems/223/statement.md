Given a set of points in the two-dimensional plane, your task is to find the minimum Euclidean distance between two distinct points.

The Euclidean distance of points (x\_1,y\_1) and (x\_2,y\_2) is \sqrt{(x\_1-x\_2)^2+(y\_1-y\_2)^2}.

# Input

The first input line has an integer n: the number of points.

After this, there are n lines that describe the points. Each line has two integers x and y. You may assume that each point is distinct.

# Output

Print one integer: d^2 where d is the minimum Euclidean distance (this ensures that the result is an integer).

# Constraints

- 2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5
- -10^9 \le x,y \le 10^9

# Example

Input:

```
4
2 1
4 4
1 2
6 3
```

Output:

```
2
```
