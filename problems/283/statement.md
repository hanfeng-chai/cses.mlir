Consider a xor pyramid where each number is the xor of lower-left and lower-right numbers. Here is an example pyramid:
![](/file/382652cc16953396bbaeeabf0e98daec74a4bda09afb8db8da0e67870205fc76)
Given the bottom row of the pyramid, your task is to find the leftmost number of each row.

# Input

The first line has an integer n: the size of the pyramid.

The next line has n integers a\_1,a\_2,\dots,a\_n: the bottom row of the pyramid.

# Output

Print n integers: the leftmost numbers of the rows from bottom to top.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5
- 1 \le a\_i \le 10^9

# Example

Input:

```
8
2 10 5 12 9 5 1 5
```

Output:

```
2 8 7 1 11 4 15 9
```
