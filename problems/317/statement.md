There are n cities and m bus companies. Each bus company operates in specific cities and sells tickets for a specific price. Buying a ticket from a bus company allows you to travel between any two cities that the company operates in.

Determine the cost of the cheapest route from Syrjälä to every city.

# Input

The first line has two integers n and m: the number of cities and bus companies. The cities are numbered 1,2,\dots,n, and city 1 is Syrjälä.

The next line has m integers c\_1, c\_2,\dots, c\_m: the ticket costs for each bus company.

After that, there are m pairs of lines describing the cities for each bus company.

The first line of each pair has a single integer k: the number of cities the bus company operates in.

The second line of each pair has k distinct integers a\_1, a\_2,\dots, a\_k: the cities the bus company operates in.

You can assume that it is possible to travel from Syrjälä to all other cities.

# Output

Print n integers: the cheapest route costs from Syrjälä to cities 1,2,\dots, n.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n, m \le 10^5
- 1 \le c \le 10^9
- 2 \le k \le n
- 1 \le a \le n
- the sum of all k is at most 2 \cdot 10^5

# Example
