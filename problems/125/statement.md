You are given an n \times n grid representing the map of a forest. Each square is either empty or contains a tree. The upper-left square has coordinates (1,1), and the lower-right square has coordinates (n,n).

Your task is to process q queries of the form: how many trees are inside a given rectangle in the forest?

# Input

The first input line has two integers n and q: the size of the forest and the number of queries.

Then, there are n lines describing the forest. Each line has n characters: `.` is an empty square and `*` is a tree.

Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. Each line has four integers y\_1, x\_1, y\_2, x\_2 corresponding to the corners of a rectangle.

# Output

Print the number of trees inside each rectangle.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n \le 1000
- 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5
- 1 \le y\_1 \le y\_2 \le n
- 1 \le x\_1 \le x\_2 \le n

# Example

Input:

```
4 3
.*..
*.**
**..

2 2 3 4
3 1 3 1
1 1 2 2
```

Output:

```
