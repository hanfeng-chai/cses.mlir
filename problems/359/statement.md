You are given an array of n integers. For each i = 1, 2,\dots, n, your task is to find the subarray ending at index i with the largest average. If there are multiple subarrays with the largest average, you should find the longest one.

# Input

The first line has an integer n: the size of the array.

The next line has n integers x\_1, x\_2,\dots, x\_n: the contents of the array.

# Output

Print n integers: the length of the subarray ending at index i with the largest average for each i = 1, 2,\dots, n.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5
- 1 \le x\_i \le 10^6

# Example

Input:

```
7
1 6 4 6 2 5 5
```

Output:

```
1 1 2 1 4 1 2
```

*Explanation*: Consider i = 5. The averages of all subarrays ending at index 5 are \frac{1 + 6 + 4 + 6 + 2}{5} = 3.8, \frac{6 + 4 + 6 + 2}{4} = 4.5, \frac{4 + 6 + 2}{3} = 4, \frac{6 + 2}{2} = 4 and \frac{2}{1} = 2. The largest average is 4.5 and the length of the corresponding subarray is 4.
