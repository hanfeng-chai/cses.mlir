Given an array of n integers, your task is to find all integers that are the xor sum in some subarray.

# Input

The first line has an integer n: the size of the array.

The next line has n integers x\_1,x\_2,\dots,x\_n: the contents of the array.

# Output

First print an integer k: the number of distinct integers that are the xor sum in some subarray.

After this print k integers: the xor sums in increasing order.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5
- 0 \le x\_i \le 10^6

# Example

Input:

```
4
5 1 5 9
```

Output:

```
7
1 4 5 8 9 12 13
```
