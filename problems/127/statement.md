You are given a list consisting of n integers. Your task is to remove elements from the list at given positions, and report the removed elements.

# Input

The first input line has an integer n: the initial size of the list. During the process, the elements are numbered 1,2,\dots,k where k is the current size of the list.

The second line has n integers x\_1,x\_2,\dots,x\_n: the contents of the list.

The last line has n integers p\_1,p\_2,\dots,p\_n: the positions of the elements to be removed.

# Output

Print the elements in the order they are removed.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5
- 1 \le x\_i \le 10^9
- 1 \le p\_i \le n-i+1

# Example

Input:

```
5
2 6 1 4 2
3 1 3 1 1
```

Output:

```
1 2 2 6 4
```

Explanation: The contents of the list are [2,6,1,4,2], [2,6,4,2], [6,4,2], [6,4], [4] and [].
