There are two line segments: the first goes through the points (x\_1,y\_1) and (x\_2,y\_2), and the second goes through the points (x\_3,y\_3) and (x\_4,y\_4).

Your task is to determine if the line segments intersect, i.e., they have at least one common point.

# Input

The first input line has an integer t: the number of tests.

After this, there are t lines that describe the tests. Each line has eight integers x\_1, y\_1, x\_2, y\_2, x\_3, y\_3, x\_4 and y\_4.

# Output

For each test, print "YES" if the line segments intersect and "NO" otherwise.

# Constraints

- 1 \le t \le 10^5
- -10^9 \le x\_1, y\_1, x\_2, y\_2, x\_3, y\_3, x\_4, y\_4 \le 10^9
- (x\_1,y\_1) \neq (x\_2,y\_2)
- (x\_3,y\_3) \neq (x\_4,y\_4)

# Example

Input:

```
5
1 1 5 3 1 2 4 3
1 1 5 3 1 1 4 3
1 1 5 3 2 3 4 1
1 1 5 3 2 4 4 1
1 1 5 3 3 2 7 4
```

Output:

```
NO
YES
YES
YES
YES
```
