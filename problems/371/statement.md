There is a ball at the top-left corner of an n \times m grid. The rows of the grid are numbered 1,2,\dots,n, and the columns are numbered 1,2,\dots,m.

The ball is initially moving diagonally away from the top-left corner. At every step, it moves one cell. Whenever the ball hits the border of the grid, it changes its direction.

What is the location of the ball after k steps and how many times has it changed direction?

# Input

The first line has an integer t: the number of tests.

After this, there are t lines. Each line has three integers n, m and k: the size of the grid and the number of steps.

# Output

For each test, print three integers: the location of the ball and the number of direction changes.

# Constraints

- 1 \le t \le 1000
- 2 \le n,m \le 10^9
- 0 \le k \le 10^{18}
