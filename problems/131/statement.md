There are n buildings in a row numbered 1, 2,\dots, n from left to right. You are standing to the left of the first building. You can see a building if it is taller than all buildings to its left.

Your task is to process q queries: If only buildings in range [a, b] existed, how many buildings would you see?

# Input

The first line has two integers n and q: the number of buildings and queries.

The second line has n integers h\_1, h\_2, \dots, h\_n: the heights of the buildings.

Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. Each line has two integers a and b.

# Output

For each query, print one integer: the number of visible buildings.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n \le 10^5
- 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5
- 1 \le h\_i \le 10^9
- 1 \le a \le b \le n

# Example

Input:

```
5 3
4 1 2 2 3
1 5
2 5
3 4
```

Output:

```
1
3
