There were n coders from Finland and n coders from Sweden in a programming contest. It turned out that after the contest, each coder had a distinct score.

Your task is to find the k-th highest score in the contest.

To do this, you can ask questions: you can choose a country (Finland or Sweden) and an integer i and you will be told the i-th highest score for the chosen country.

# Interaction

This is an interactive problem. Your code will interact with the grader using standard input and output. You should start by reading two integers n and k.

On your turn, you can print one of the following:

- "\mathrm{F}\ i", where 1 \le i \le n: ask the i-th highest score for Finland.
- "\mathrm{S}\ i", where 1 \le i \le n: ask the i-th highest score for Sweden.
- "!\ s": report that the k-th highest score is s. Your program must terminate after this.

Each line should be followed by a line break. You must make sure the output gets flushed after printing each line.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n \le 10^5
- 1 \le k \le 2n
- each score is between 1 and 10^9
- you can ask at most 100 queries of the first two types in total

# Example

```
3 1
F 1
9
S 1
8
! 9
```

*Explanation*: The scores for Finland are [9, 4, 3] and the scores for Sweden are [8, 6, 1]. Since k = 1, the task is to find the highest score overall, which in this case is 9.
