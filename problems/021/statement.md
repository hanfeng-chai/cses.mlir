You are given an n\times m grid where each cell contains one character `A`, `B`, `C` or `D`.

For each cell, you must change the character to `A`, `B`, `C` or `D`. The new character must be different from the old one.

Your task is to change the characters in every cell such that no two adjacent cells have the same character.

# Input

The first line has two integers n and m: the number of rows and columns.

The next n lines each have m characters: the description of the grid.

# Output

Print n lines each with m characters: the description of the final grid.

You may print any valid solution.

If no solution exists, just print `IMPOSSIBLE`.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n, m \le 500

# Example

Input:

```
3 4
AAAA
BBBB
CCDD
```

Output:

```
CDCD
DCDC
ABAB
```
