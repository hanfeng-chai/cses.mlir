There is a hidden permutation a\_1, a\_2,\dots, a\_n of integers 1, 2,\dots, n. Your task is to find this permutation.

To do this, you can ask questions: you can choose two indices i and j and you will be told if a\_i < a\_j.

# Interaction

This is an interactive problem. Your code will interact with the grader using standard input and output. You should start by reading a single integer n: the length of the permutation.

On your turn, you can print one of the following:

- "?\ i\ j", where 1 \le i, j \le n: ask if a\_i < a\_j. The grader will return `YES` if a\_i < a\_j and `NO` otherwise.
- "!\ a\_1\ a\_2 \dots a\_n": report that the hidden permutation is a\_1, a\_2,\dots, a\_n. Your program must terminate after this.

Each line should be followed by a line break. You must make sure the output gets flushed after printing each line.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n \le 1000
- you can ask at most 10^4 questions of type ?

# Example

```
3
? 3 2
NO
? 3 1
YES
! 3 1 2
```

Explanation: The hidden permutation is [3, 1, 2]. The first question asks if a\_3 < a\_2 which is false, so the answer is `NO`. The second question asks if a\_3 < a\_1 which is true, so the answer is `YES`.
