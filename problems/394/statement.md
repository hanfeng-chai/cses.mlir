Given a set of n positive integers, your task is to choose two disjoint subsets of the elements that have the same sum.

# Input

The first line has an integer n: the set size.

The second line has n integers x\_1,x\_2,\dots,x\_n: the set elements.

# Output

For both subsets, first print the size of the subset and then its contents. You can print any valid solution. If there is no solution, print `IMPOSSIBLE`.

# Constraints

- 3 \le n \le 40
- \sum\_{i=1}^{n} x\_i \le 2^{n}-2

# Example

Input:

```
6
1 2 3 5 7 8
```

Output:

```
2
2 3
1
5
```

*Explanation*: The first subset is \{2,3\} and the second subset is \{5\}.
