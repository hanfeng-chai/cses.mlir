You are given an array of n integers and q queries. In each query, your task is to calculate the maximum subarray sum in the range [a,b].

Empty subarrays (with sum 0) are allowed.

# Input

The first line contains two integers n and q: the number of elements and the number of queries.

Then there are n integers x\_1,x\_2,\ldots,x\_n: the contents of the array.

Finally there are q lines that describe the queries. Each line has two integers a and b.

# Output

Print the answer for each query.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n, q\le 2 \cdot 10^5
- -10^9 \le x\_i \le 10^9
- 1 \le a \le b \le n

# Example

Input:

```
8 4
2 5 1 -2 3 -1 -7 1
2 4
2 5
6 7
4 8
```

Output:

```
6
7
0
3
```
