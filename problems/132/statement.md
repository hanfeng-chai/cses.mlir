Given an array x of n integers, your task is to process q queries of the form: how many integers i satisfy a \le i \le b and c \le x\_i \le d?

# Input

The first line has two integers n and q: the number of values and queries.

The second line has n integers x\_1,x\_2,\dots,x\_n: the array values.

Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. Each line has four integers a, b, c and d: how many integers i satisfy a \le i \le b and c \le x\_i \le d?

# Output

Print the result of each query.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n,q \le 2 \cdot 10^5
- 1 \le x\_i \le 10^9
- 1 \le a \le b \le n
- 1 \le c \le d \le 10^9

# Example

Input:

```
8 4
3 2 4 5 1 1 5 3
2 4 2 4
5 6 2 9
1 8 1 5
3 3 4 4
```

Output:

```
2
0
8
1
```
