You are given an array of n integers. Your task is to count the number of ways to split the array into continuous segments such that all segments consists of distinct values.

# Input

The first line has an integers n: the size of the array.

The next line has n integers x\_1, x\_2,\dots, x\_n: the contents of the array.

# Output

Print one integer: the answer to the problem modulo 10^9 + 7.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5
- 1 \le x\_i \le 10^9

# Example

Input:

```
4
1 2 1 3
```

Output:

```
6
```

*Explanation*: There are six valid splits:

- [1], [2], [1], [3]
- [1], [2], [1, 3]
- [1], [2, 1], [3]
- [1], [2, 1, 3]
- [1, 2], [1], [3]
- [1, 2], [1, 3]
