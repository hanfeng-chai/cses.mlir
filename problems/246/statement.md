You are playing a game that consists of n levels. Each level has a monster. On levels 1,2,\dots,n-1, you can either kill or escape the monster. However, on level n you must kill the final monster to win the game.

Killing a monster takes sf time where s is the monster's strength and f is your skill factor (lower skill factor is better). After killing a monster, you get a new skill factor. What is the minimum total time in which you can win the game?

# Input

The first input line has two integers n and x: the number of levels and your initial skill factor.

The second line has n integers s\_1,s\_2,\dots,s\_n: each monster's strength.

The third line has n integers f\_1,f\_2,\dots,f\_n: your new skill factor after killing a monster.

# Output

Print one integer: the minimum total time to win the game.

# Constraints

- 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5
- 1 \le x \le 10^6
- 1 \le s\_1 \le s\_2 \le \dots \le s\_n \le 10^6
- x \ge f\_1 \ge f\_2 \ge \dots \ge f\_n \ge 1

# Example

Input:

```
5 100
20 30 30 50 90
90 60 20 20 10
```

Output:

```
4800
```

Explanation: The best way to play is to kill the third and fifth monster.
