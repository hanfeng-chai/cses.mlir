Given a tree of n nodes, your task is to count the number of distinct paths that have at least k\_1 and at most k\_2 edges.

# Input

The first input line contains three integers n, k\_1 and k\_2: the number of nodes and the path lengths. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\ldots,n.

Then there are n-1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b.

# Output

Print one integer: the number of paths.

# Constraints

- 1 \le k\_1 \le k\_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5
- 1 \le a,b \le n

# Example

Input:

```
5 2 3
1 2
2 3
3 4
3 5
```

Output:

```
6
```
