There is a line that goes through the points p\_1=(x\_1,y\_1) and p\_2=(x\_2,y\_2). There is also a point p\_3=(x\_3,y\_3).

Your task is to determine whether p\_3 is located on the left or right side of the line or if it touches the line when we are looking from p\_1 to p\_2.

# Input

The first input line has an integer t: the number of tests.

After this, there are t lines that describe the tests. Each line has six integers: x\_1, y\_1, x\_2, y\_2, x\_3 and y\_3.

# Output

For each test, print "LEFT", "RIGHT" or "TOUCH".

# Constraints

- 1 \le t \le 10^5
- -10^9 \le x\_1, y\_1, x\_2, y\_2, x\_3, y\_3 \le 10^9
- x\_1 \neq x\_2 or y\_1 \neq y\_2

# Example

Input:

```
3
1 1 5 3 2 3
1 1 5 3 4 1
1 1 5 3 3 2
```

Output:

```
LEFT
RIGHT
TOUCH
```
